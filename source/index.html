<p>In this experiment, we work with a well-known historical encryption scheme, namely the shift cipher, that has a very small key space.</p>
<p>Your task is to break the shift cipher. Specifically, given (only) the ciphertext in some instance of a shift cipher, you need to find the plaintext and the secret key.</p>

      An arm of a robot may be modeled as a collection of hierarchical objects. In order to perform transformations on a heirarchical composite, one needs to compose a series of transformations on the constituent parts. This experiment demonstrates how to encode such operations as a series of matric operations representing basic transformations.

        <p>3D projection is any method of mapping three dimensional points to a two-dimensional plane represented by the viewport of the computer screen. There are two types of projections: Orthographic and Perspective. In orthographic projection, an object is depicted using parallel lines to project its shape onto a plane. Orthographic projections are mostly used to show the details or precise measurements of a three dimensional object. On the other hand, when the human eye views a scene, objects in the distance appear smaller than objects close by - this is known as perspective. A perspective definition projection depicts distant objects as smaller in order to provide additional realism.</p>

      <p class="experiment-outcome">Objective of this experiment is to understand different projections and their matrix representations to project a 3D point. We also learn how to define an OpenGL camera and its various parameters effectively visualising the result.</p>

The algorithm divides a two-dimensional space into nine regions, and then efficiently determines the lines and portions of lines that are visible in the viewport. It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to determine if the line segment's endpoints are within the viewport.

        <p>The Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm finds the polygon that is the intersection between an arbitrary polygon (the “subject polygon”) and a convex polygon (the “clip polygon”). The algorithm begins with an input list of all vertices in the subject polygon. Next, one side of the clip polygon is extended infinitely in both directions, and the path of the subject polygon is traversed. Vertices from the input list are inserted into an output list if they lie on the visible side of the extended clip polygon line, and new vertices are added to the output list where the subject polygon path crosses the extended clip polygon line. This process is repeated iteratively for each clip polygon side, using the output list from one stage as the input list for the next. Once all sides of the clip polygon have been processed, the final generated list of vertices defines a new single polygon that is entirely visible.</p>
